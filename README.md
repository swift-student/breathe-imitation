# breathe-imitation
This is my entry for the first Swift Over Coffee challenge to imitate the animation from the Breathe app in 1 hour. I did take a bit of time to figure out how a watch app worked before I started my 1 hour timer, since I hadn't done anything for watch before. The animation could be a lot closer, but I'm happy with what I got in the time given.
